# ShinyNormApprox

This is code for an R Shiny app to demonstrate the normal approximation to the poisson distribution 
(used with large mean parameter) and the normal approximation to the binomial distribution (which
has many rules of thumb for use - say np>=10 and n(1-p)>=10).

The app can be viewed [link](http://teaching.stat.ncsu.edu:3838/jbpost2/NormalApproximation/ "here").
